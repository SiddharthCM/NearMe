Koyambedu is one of the busiest and most important localities in Chennai, known for its major transport and market hubs. It is home to the Koyambedu Bus Terminus (CMBT), one of Asia’s largest bus stations, connecting Chennai with towns and cities across Tamil Nadu and neighbouring states. The area is also famous for the Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex (KWMC), one of India’s biggest wholesale markets for vegetables, fruits, and flowers.
