            A museum is a place where valuable objects from history, science, art, and culture are collected, preserved, and displayed for the public. It helps people learn about the past and understand how societies, traditions, and knowledge have developed over time. Museums often contain artefacts, paintings, sculptures, fossils, documents, and models that tell stories about different eras and civilizations.
Modern museums also use interactive displays, videos, and digital technology to make learning more engaging. They are important educational spaces that inspire curiosity, creativity, and respect for heritage. Whether it is an art museum, science museum, or history museum, each one plays a vital role in protecting knowledge and sharing it with future generations.</p>
